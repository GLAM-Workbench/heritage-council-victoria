    "# Introduction to the Victorian Heritage Database API\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Victorian Heritage Register](https://heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/heritage-protection/register/) maintains the [Victorian Heritage Database](https://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/) \n",
    "which contains information about the state's most significant places. The databse can be searched through \n",
    "the website, but it can also be accessed through an unauthenticated API. This means there is no need to \n",
    "register to get started. You just start!\n",
    " \n",
    "The API is documented at:\n",
    " \n",
    "> https://api.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/documentation\n",
    " \n",
    "The API is so easy to use that you can make your first API request simply by loading a URL:\n",
    " \n",
    "> https://api.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/v1/heritage-authorities?hasListings=true\n",
    " \n",
    "Easy!\n",
    " \n",
    "This URL returns all of the heritage authories that have at least one listing. These include \n",
    "Heritage Victoria, various Local Government Authorities, The Victorian War Heritage Inventory \n",
    "and the National Trust. Not that you could tell these are the authorities because the webpage \n",
    "formatting is almost impossible to read. The format is called [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp) \n",
    "and it is easy for computers to read, but humans can struggle. Itâ€™s a bit like HTML. So let's \n",
    "use some code to load the JSON data and  output it in a slightly more human friendly manner. "
